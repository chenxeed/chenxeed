  <h2>VueJS with CycleJS Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    How is that possible? Here is the proof concept!
  </p>
  <p>
    For the global event from parent to be passed to the children, which is each of
    these cute counters, update this input to restart the counter value.
    <br />
    <input type="number" v-model.number="counterStart" />
  </p>
  <div>
    <h3>This is VueJS Counter Component</h3>
    <div class="mdl-grid">
      <p class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
        Can the app listen to the VueJS Counter changes?
        {{ vueCounterMessage }}
      </p>
      <vue-counter class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col"
        :count-start="counterStart"
        @update:count="vueCounterChange"
        @update:act="vueCounterActionChange"
      />
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>This is CycleJS Counter Component</h3>
    <div class="mdl-grid">
      <p class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
        It's wrapped by vue component btw, but just to generate the container.<br/>
        How about CycleJS App Counter, can I still listen to it?
        {{ cycleCounterMessage }}
      </p>
      <cycle-counter class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col"
        :count-start="counterStart"
        @update:count="cycleCounterChange"
        @update:act="cycleCounterActionChange"
      />
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>And lastly, this is the VueJS Counter Component (with Cycle Philosophy)</h3>
    <div class="mdl-grid">
      <p class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
        It is written in vueJS component, but the way to run the data flow is inspired by CycleJS philosophy, which is to:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>use streams for the app logic</li>
          <li>pure functions without any instance</li>
          <li>and manage the side effect at the end of each flow</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Last to test, can the app listen to it? {{vueCycleCounterMessage}}
      </p>
      <vue-cycle-counter class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col"
        :count-start="counterStart"
        @update:count="vueCycleCounterChange"
        @update:act="vueCycleCounterActionChange"
      />
    </div>
  </div>
